##### 1) Try TMIDI with the Summarization implementations. Can music be summarized? Can this be used to make bridges between musical pieces?

##### 2) Try TMIDI with QA implementations. Does music have QA elements? 

##### 3) Try TMIDI with Translator implementations. How music can be translated and permutated?!?

##### 4) Try TMIDI with Sentiment Analysis...etc.

##### Enjoy and have fun :)
